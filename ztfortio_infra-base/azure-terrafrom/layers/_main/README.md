# _main

This layer should be executed only once per environment to estatblish the remote state storage
that Terraform uses for configuration.  Once this layer exists, it is used for keeping track
of changes to the environments as well as the data that is output to allow communicating
between the layers i.e 100_base <- 200_datalake.  It is the case that a higher numbered layer
may access data from a lower number layer, but a lower numbered layer may never access data
from a higher numbered layer.  For example, 200_datalake -> 300_integration is not allowed. 

## Inputs

data source within the numbered layers.
